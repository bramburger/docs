This is the core agreement for where all other agreements are incorporated as amendments.</li> <li>The <strong>Services agreement</strong> is attached to one data processor agreement and regulates the cloud services specifications and conditions for resource consumption, cost and billing.</li> <li>The <strong>Data space agreement</strong> is attached to one services agreement and defines one central space where research leaders coordinates one to many labs.</li> <li>The <strong>Lab agreement</strong> is attached to one data space agreement and defines one digital environment that combines access to cloud resources for individual data processing.</li> <li>The <strong>User agreement</strong> is attached to one lab agreement and authorizes one individual (lab user) access to one individual lab.</li></ol> <p>We know, this is complex. Although it might seem complicated at the first glance, we think that the hierarchy provides a solid framework for flexibility. All to ensure your researchers freedom to explore.</p> <h2 id="data-processor-agreements"><a href="#data-processor-agreements" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data processor agreements</h2> <p>The data processor agreement is on top of our agreement hierarchy because it regulates one of the most important asset in digital science: your organization's trustworthiness towards research participants (data protection and data privacy).</p> <p>The remaining agreements on this page are therefore formally incorporated into the data processor agreement as attachments.</p> <h3 id="content"><a href="#content" class="header-anchor">#</a> Content</h3> <p>In short, the data processor agreement defines that your organization owns the data that you upload and generate in HUNT Cloud. And it specify the required privacy and security controls that are to be in place to protect your data.</p> <p>The data processor agreement allows your research to be compliant with the Data Protection Directive from EU (GDPR) and relevant Norwegian laws and regulations, including partly compliance with the Norwegian «<em>Norm for informasjonssikkerhet</em>».</p> <h3 id="parties"><a href="#parties" class="header-anchor">#</a> Parties</h3> <p>The data processor agreement is formally agreed between your host organization that control your data (data controller), and our host institution that process the data on your behalf (data processor).</p> <p>Your signatory will be the individual that is authorize to control your data on behalf of your organization.

For NTNU controllers, this is the name of your department.</li> <li><em>controller.affiliation:</em> Include additional organizational affiliations if relevant. For NTNU controllers, this is the name of your faculty.</li> <li><em>controller.institution:</em> This is your main institutional name. For NTNU controllers, this is NTNU.</li> <li><em>controller.enterprise.no:</em> This is your enterprise number. For NTNU controllers, leave blank.</li> <li><em>controller.part.of.ntnu:</em> State &quot;yes&quot; if you are part of NTNU and &quot;no&quot; if you are not. NTNU agreements differ slightly in their wording and holds a different dispute resolution clause.</li></ul> <p><strong>Agreement date</strong></p> <p>This is the approximate start date of the agreement. We use this for re-negotiations of the agreement which is expected every two years. For the record, the agreement starts formally when it is signed by both parties.</p> <p><strong>Signatory official</strong></p> <p>This is the name of the individual that are authorized to sign the data processor agreement on behalf of the institution. For NTNU, this is the head of your department.</p> <p><strong>Administrative contact person</strong></p> <p>This is the name of the individual that will coordinate administrative aspects of the data processor agreement. The individual will act as the deputy contact for other contacts if needed.</p> <p><strong>Scientific contact person</strong></p> <p>This is the name of the individual that will coordinate scientific aspects between the data controller, services centers, data space leaders and HUNT Cloud. This include services developments, knowledge transfers between data spaces, reporting etc. For NTNU, this is typically a research adviser at the department.</p> <p><strong>Data protection officer</strong></p> <p>This is the name of the individual that will coordinate privacy aspects of the data processor agreement. There is an expectation of direct communication in the case of suspected or confirmed data breach. For NTNU, leave this field blank as we will include the Data Protection Officer at NTNU.</p> <p><strong>Information security officer</strong></p> <p>This is the name of the individual that will coordinate information security aspects of the data processor agreement. There is an expectation of direct communication for evaluation of major system changes and audit results. For NTNU, this may be security officers at your faculty or <em>Seksjon for digital sikkerhet</em> at NTNU IT.</p> <p><strong>Security incident response</strong></p> <p>This is the emergency response contact during suspected or confirmed data loss or data breach. Emergency numbers are expected to respond around the clock. For NTNU, leave blank as this is NTNU SOC.</p> <p><strong>Agreement type</strong></p> <p>This section defines the overall agreement type (data processor or data subprocessor agreement). See FAQ section below whether HUNT Cloud will be your &quot;data processor&quot; or your &quot;data subprocessor&quot;. Specify &quot;Databehandler&quot; for data processor, and &quot;Underdatabehandler&quot; for data subprocessor.</p> <p><strong>Organization type</strong></p> <p>This section defines the dispute clause. Specify &quot;Public&quot; if your organization is organized under a Norwegian Ministry, such as an University, Health trust, Municipality etc. Specify &quot;Private&quot; for other options. Public organizations will use the Ministry of Education and Research (KD) for resolutions, while disputes with private organizations will be resolved in court.</p> <p><strong>Purpose of processing</strong></p> <p>This information is aimed at the overall processing purpose of the information under your data spaces and labs. This is addition to the information on the processing in individual labs that are collected in our lab agreements.</p> <ul><li><em>purpose.pro:</em> This defines the overall purpose of the planned data processing, such as research, health services, innovation etc. For NTNU, state &quot;Research&quot; for normal cases.</li> <li><em>purpose.cat:</em> This defines the broad categories of data subjects of the processing. This may for example be research participants, patients etc. NTNU controllers, &quot;Research participants&quot; is the most common category.</li> <li><em>purpose.con:</em> This specify the content of personal data included in the processing. Se example in Norwegian below:</li></ul> <p><em>Kategorier av personopplysning vil kunne omfatte helseopplysninger, genetiske opplysninger og biometriske opplysninger jf. Personvernforordningen artikkel 9 (1) som selvrapporterte helseopplysninger, undersøkelsesdata, bildedata og uttrekk fra journalopplysninger.</em></p> <p><strong>Agreement tag</strong></p> <p>This is our internal tag (indentifier) for your organization.

We have therefore developed a separate &quot;enighetsavtale&quot; for departments within NTNU (since we both are part of the same enterprise).</p> <p>The &quot;enighetsavtale&quot; clarifies the same rights and protections as our regular processor agreement with one exception: Disputes will be resolved with binding effect by NTNU's management with our Rector as the last instance.</p> <h3 id="data-subprocessor-agreement"><a href="#data-subprocessor-agreement" class="header-anchor">#</a> Data subprocessor agreement</h3> <p>Sometimes you may be processing data on behalf of others. This is the case when the processing purpose if defined by another organization than your host organization (contract research).</p> <p>To illustrate, this may be the case if you provide analytical expertise to a project that is controlled/managed by another organization, and you want to transfer their data to your lab to take advantage of your established tools and resources.</p> <p>In such circumstances your data provider may be the &quot;data controller&quot; and you may be the &quot;data processor&quot;. If so, HUNT Cloud may be the &quot;data subprocessor&quot; (data underbehandler).
