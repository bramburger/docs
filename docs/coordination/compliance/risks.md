# Risk management

**This page aims to assist data controllers, compliance coordinators and lab coordinators on their quest to document, assess and evaluate security and privacy risks for their scientific work in HUNT Cloud.** 

[[toc]]


## Responsibilities

First, it is our responsibility to provide your with information on services in HUNT Cloud so you can identify and evaluate security and privacy risks. 

It is your responsibility to assess, document and evaluate this information in your own scientific context, typically in form of a privacy or security assessment (see below). 

It is also your responsibility to inform your "risk owner" about any "residual risk" that you may identify and get appropriate acceptance for such risks.

::: tip Residual risk

It is impossible to eliminate all risks. Thus, there will often be some kind of unwanted risk left after the security and privacy controls are evaluated. We call this "*residual risk*". Such residual risk may need to be mitigated or accepted. We call the individual that have the authority to accept such residual risks "*risk owner"*.

## Assessments

### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

The data processing in your labs may require a Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) prior to the initiation of scientific activities (GDPR Article 35).

See the [resources](/coordination/riskmanagement/#resources) to get going, and [contact us](/contact) for review of written text. We are happy to assist compliance coordinators with this work. 

### Risk assessment reports (RAR)

Your organization may request risk assessments of your activities when it comes to information security and/or privacy ("ROS-analyse" in Norwegian). 

We are happy to assist with information and explanations of our system and configurations. See the [resources](/coordination/riskmanagement/#resources) for our initial information, and [contact us](/contact) if you need additional clarifications. 

## Audits

Data controllers are welcome to check that our systems and services are implemented and operated as stated (audits). You are welcome to conduct both on-screen and physical audit sessions.

Compliance coordinators are also welcome to participate in our internal audit session for educational purposes. [Contact us](/contact) if you are interested in such arrangements. 

Certificates from our third-party audits are available for downloads on our [certificates](/certificates/) page.

## Resources

We have made a selection of our security and privacy information public to support your risk management work:

- [Security and privacy policies](/policies). These are the documents that we build our security and privacy framework on. "Security and privacy policies" provides a list of individual security controls that are implemented in HUNT Cloud.
- [Statement of applicability](/certificates/) (SoA). This document state the implementation status of our security and privacy controls specified in our policy documents. 
- [ISO certificates](/certificates/). These documents provides third-party evaluations of the compliance with our Statement of applicability.
- [Current risks and audit status](/tingweek/#reports). Our ting reports includes updated information of our overarching risks as we see them under the "Risk factors" chapter. An updated summary of our laws and regulations and audit results are listed under the "External and internal controls" chapter. 
- [Services specifications](/services/specifications/). This document specify responsibilities and clarifies security measures for individual services. The document is an appendix to your [services agreement](agreements/overview/#services-agreement) which is incorporated under our [data controller agreement](/agreements/overview/#data-processor-agreement).

[Contact us](/contact) if you need additional information for your risk assessment.

## FAQ

### Do you participate in risk assessment meetings? 

Yes. We prioritize risk assessment meetings with data controllers to assist with information and clarifications. For quick responses, we prefer to guide compliance coordinators and lab coordinators towards relevant information and comment on text that you have written. [Contact us](/contact) for such arrangements.

### Do you have standardized text that I can use? 

You need to make your own assessment of risk that is relevant for your scientific context. We do therefore not provide generic risk texts. When that is said, dependent on your assessment type we may have tailored text in stock to guide your work.

### Do you allow third-party audits? 

Yes. Data controllers may hire external companies to conduct audits of our systems and services on their behalf. 

### Do you allow technical security tests? 

Yes. You will need our approval of such testing *prior* to initiation. [Contact us](/contact) for arrangements and agreements.
