## FAQ

### Do you have standardized text that I can use? 

It is important that you make your own clarifications of the information that is required for your specific assessment. Depending on your assessment type we may have tailored text in stock.

### Do you participate in risk assessment meetings? 

For efficiency, we do prefer to guide you toward relevant documentation and comment on text that you have written.

### Do you allow third-party audits? 

Yes, data controllers may hire external companies to conduct audits of our systems and services to ensure that our security and privacy are in compliance with their requirements. 

### Do you allow technical security tests of your services? 
Yes, we do. However, you will need to approve such testing in writing prior to initiation. [Contact us](/contact) for such arrangements.

### How do I know if a risk is acceptable? 

It is impossible to eliminate all risks. There will often be some kind of unwanted risk left after our security controls are implemented. We call this "*residual risk*". Such risks needs to be accepted by you "*risk owner"*. This is often one representative from your data controller, although you need to contact your data space leader for clarification of responsibilities and delegated authority within your institution.
