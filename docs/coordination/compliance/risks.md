# Risk management

This page contains information to assist data controllers, compliance coordinators and lab coordinators on their quest to document, assess and evaluate security and privacy risks for scientific work in HUNT Cloud.

## Responsibilities

It is our responsibility to provide information so you can identify and make informed decisions about security and privacy risks related to your use of our services. 

It is your responsibility to assess, document and evaluate this information in your own scientific context, typically in form of a privacy or security assessment (see below). 

It is also your responsibility to inform your "risk owner" about any "residual risk" that you may identify and get appropriate acceptance for such risks.

::: tip Residual risk acceptance

It is impossible to eliminate all risks. Thus, there will often be some kind of unwanted risk left after the security and privacy controls are evaluated. We call this "*residual risk*". Such residual risk may need to be mitigated or accepted. We call the individual that have the authority to accept such residual risks "*risk owner"*.

## Assessments

### Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA)

The data processing in your labs may require a Data Protection Impact Assessments (DPIA) prior to the initiation of scientific activities (GDPR Article 35).

See the [resources](/coordination/riskmanagement/#resources) to get going, and [contact us](/contact) for review of written text. We are happy to assist compliance coordinators with this work. 

### Risk assessment reports (RAR)

Your organization may request risk assessments of your activities when it comes to information security and/or privacy ("ROS-analyse" in Norwegian). 

We are happy to assist data controllers and compliance coordinators in data spaces in this work so you best can identify residual risks associated with your scientific work in your data space and labs.

Note that your data controller is responsible for the acceptance of residuals risks that you identify related to our services.


## Audits

Data controllers are welcome to check that our systems and services are implemented and operated as specified (audits). 

Compliance coordinators are welcome to participate in our internal audits for educational purposes. [Contact us](/contact) for such arrangements. 

Certificates from our third-party audits are available for downloads on our [certificates](/certificates/) page.


## Resources

We have made a selection of our security and privacy information public to support your risk management work:

- [Security and privacy policies](/policies). These are the documents that we build our security and privacy framework on. "Security and privacy policies" provides a list of individual security controls that are implemented in HUNT Cloud.
- [Statement of applicability](/certificates/) (SoA). This document state the implementation status of our security and privacy controls specified in our policy documents. 
- [ISO certificates](/certificates/). These documents provides third-party evaluations of the compliance with our Statement of applicability.
- [Ting report](/tingweek/#reports). Our ting reports includes updated information of our overarching risks as we see them under the "Risk factors" chapter and a summary of our laws and regulations and our audit programs under the "External and internal controls" chapter. 
- [Services specifications](/services/specifications/). This document specify responsibilities and clarifies security measures for individual services. The document is an appendix to your [services agreement](agreements/overview/#services-agreement) which is incorporated under our [data controller agreement](/agreements/overview/#data-processor-agreement).

[Contact us](/contact) if you need additional information for your risk evaluation.

## FAQ

### Do you participate in risk assessment meetings? 

Yes. We prioritize risk assessment meetings with data controllers to assist in their risk assessments. For quick responses, we prefer to guide compliance coordinators and lab coordinators towards relevant information and comment on text that you have written. [Contact us](/contact) for such arrangements.

### Do you have standardized text that I can use? 

You need to make your own assessment of the information that is required for your scientific work. Thus, we do not provide generic text for such use. When that is said, dependent on your assessment type we may have tailored text in stock.

### Do you allow third-party audits? 

Yes, as a data controller your may hire external companies to conduct audits of our systems and services on your behalf. 

### Do you allow technical security tests? 

Yes. You will need our approval in writing of such tests prior to initiation. [Contact us](/contact) for such arrangements and agreement templates.
