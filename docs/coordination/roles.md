# Coordinator roles

**High impact science needs smooth and seamless coordination to fly. Scientific coordinators are the personnel that guard this magic dust. We have established several coordinator  roles to help with this work.**

[[toc]]

Our main intention with the roles is to unify activities and simplify knowledge transfers across labs under the same data space. 

We also aim to use the roles to simplify knowledge transfers between coordinators within our community, and to structure feedback on our future development in the [coordinator tings](/tingweek/). And last, we want to use the experience to advocate for the importance of scientific coordinators in high-impact data-driven science.


### Compliance coordinator

The compliance coordinator is the point of contact for issues related agreements and compliance evaluations. This includes coordination of 

* agreements related to the data space, including data space agreements and appendixes, lab orders, external kistas forms, and discussions on general contractual aspects within the data space. 
* compliance evaluations related to the data space, including ethical approvals for the research, privacy assessment (DPIA) and security assessments (RAR/ROS). 

The compliance coordinator act as deputy for other contacts when needed, including for the data space leader. The role is linked to an individual in the data space agreement. 

### Data coordinator

The data coordinator is the point of contact for issues related to data handling for labs inside the data space. This includes coordination of data transfers, archiving and backup practices and similar under the data space. The role is linked to an individual in the data space agreement.

### Technical coordinator

The technical coordinator is the point of contact for issues related to the technical aspects of our cloud services and analytical tools across labs. This includes coordination of configurations, adjustments and maintenance for labs under the data space. The role is linked to an individual in the data space agreement.

### Knowledge coordinator

The knowledge coordinator is the point of contact for knowledge transfers between lab users across labs under the data space, including know-hows related to user onboardings, common tasks, practical analytical setups, documentation etc. The role is linked to an individual in the data space agreement.

### Lab coordinator

Individual labs has one lab coordinator in addition to the lab leader that is the point of contact both for us and the data space coordinators for practical issues related to the lab. The coordinator act as deputy for the lab leader when needed and is authorized to request and adjust cloud resources on behalf of the Lab leader. The role is linked to an individual in the lab order.
