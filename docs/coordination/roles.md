# Coordinator roles

**Your quest for high impact discoveries needs smooth and seamless coordination to fly. Scientific coordinators are the individuals that make such magic dusts.**

[[toc]]

We have defined a few important coordinator roles within key responsibility areas. Our primary goal is to simplify knowledge transfers between labs within your data space. 

In addition, the roles are established to ease knowledge transfers between coordinators within our cloud community, to structure feedback on our administrative development (such as in our [coordinator ting](/tingweek/#coordinator-ting)), and to use the experience to jointly define and champion the identity and importance of scientific coordination in high-impact data-driven science.

Individuals are given to their respective roles in your [data space orders](/agreements/overview/#data-space-order) and [lab orders](/agreements/overview/#lab-order).

### Compliance coordinator

The compliance coordinator is the point of contact for issues related agreements and compliance evaluations. This includes coordination of 

* agreements related to the data space, including data space agreements and appendixes, lab orders, external kistas forms, and discussions on general contractual aspects within the data space. 
* compliance evaluations related to the data space, including ethical approvals for the research, privacy assessment (DPIA) and security assessments (RAR/ROS). 

The compliance coordinator act as deputy for other contacts when needed, including for the data space leader.

### Data coordinator

The data coordinator is the point of contact for issues related to data handling for labs inside the data space. This includes coordination of data transfers, archiving and backup practices and similar under the data space. 

### Technical coordinator

The technical coordinator is the point of contact for issues related to the technical aspects of our cloud services and analytical tools across labs. This includes coordination of configurations, adjustments and maintenance for labs under the data space.

### Knowledge coordinator

The knowledge coordinator is the point of contact for knowledge transfers between lab users across labs under the data space, including know-hows related to user onboardings, common tasks, practical analytical setups, documentation etc.

### Lab coordinator

Individual labs has one lab coordinator in addition to the lab leader that is the point of contact both for us and the data space coordinators for practical issues related to the lab. The coordinator act as deputy for the lab leader when needed and is authorized to request and adjust cloud resources on behalf of the Lab leader.
