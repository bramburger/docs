# Overview of administrative agreements

We know, it can be difficult to keep up with the piles of papers that might be required to make your science fly. As much as we would like, we can not make them disappear. 

However, we can help you with a structured overview of the various agreements that you will need in order to fully utilize the powers of HUNT Cloud.

The below text is intended for research coordinators in HUNT Cloud.

[[toc]]





## Overview

Our agreements are organized in four layers:

1. the **data processor agreement** on the organizational level regulates ownership and protection of data;
2. the **data space agreement** on the research center level regulates control and adjustments of cloud services consumption;
3. the **lab agreement** regulates data processing within individual collaborations under a data space;
4. the **user agreement** regulates the acceptable use policies for users that gets access to individual labs.

One organization or department (data processor agreement) can attach several research centers or research groups (data space agreements), that each can attach several research projects (lab agreements), which again can attach several individual researchers (user agreements). 


Let's dig in.






## Data processor agreements

The data processor agreement is the mother ship of our agreement hierarchy. We have placed this agreement on top since it regulates an important asset of your research: your organization's trustworthiness towards your research participants. This is often named privacy and information security aspects.

It is from this agreement that all further arrangements between us are controlled. The other agreements are therefore formally incorporated into the data processor agreement as attachments. 



### Processor content

In brief, this agreement defines that your organization owns the data that you upload and generate in HUNT Cloud. It also defines which privacy and security controls that are in place to protect your data. 

The data processor agreement allows your research to be compliant with the Data Protection Directive from EU (GDPR) and relevant Norwegian laws and regulations, including partly compliance with the Norwegian «*Norm for informasjonssikkerhet*».

### Processor parties

The data processor agreement is formally agreed between your host organization that control your data (data controller), and our host institution that process the data on your behalf (data processor). 

Your signatory will be the individual that is authorize to control your data on behalf of your organization. This may range from top management via head of departments to individuals in various organizational units.

Our signatory will be the head of our department.

This is the name of the individual that will coordinate administrative aspects of the data processor agreement. The individual will act as the deputy contact for other contacts if needed.

**Scientific contact person** 

This is the name of the individual that will coordinate scientific aspects of between the data controller, data space leaders and HUNT Cloud. This include services developments, knowledge transfers between data spaces, reporting etc. For NTNU controllers, this is typically a research advisor at the department.

**Data protection officer**

This is the name of the individual that will coordinate privacy aspects of the data processor agreement. There is an expectation of direct communication in the case of suspected or confirmed data breach. For NTNU controllers, leave blank as this is the Data Protection Officer at NTNU.

**Information security officer**

This is the name of the individual that will coordinate information security aspects of the data processor agreement. There is an expectation of direct communication for evaluation of major system changes and audit results. For NTNU controllers, this may be security officers at your faculty or Seksjon for digital sikkerhet at NTNU IT.

**Security incident response**

This is the emergency response contact during suspected or confirmed data loss or data breach. Emergency numbers are expected to response around the clock. For NTNU controllers, leave blank as this is NTNU SOC.

**Agreement type**

This section defines the overall agreement type. See FAQ section below whether your are a "data processor" or a "data subprocessor". Specify "Databehandler" for data processor, and "Underdatabehandler" for data subprocessor. 

**Organization type**

This section defines the dispute clause. Specify "Public" if your organization is organized under a Norwegian Ministry, such as an University, Health trust, Municipality etc. Specify "Private" for other options.

**Purpose of processing**

This information is aimed at the overall processing purpose of the information under your data spaces and labs. Individual processes in projects are specified in lab agreements.

- *purpose.pro:* This defines the overall purpose of the planned data processing, such as research, health services, innovation etc. For NTNU controllers, state "Research".
- *purpose.cat:* This defines the broad categories of data subjects of the processing. This may for example be research participants, patients etc. For NTNU controllers, "Research participants" is the most common category.
- *purpose.con:* This specify the content of personal data included in the processing. Se example below: 

*Kategorier av personopplysning vil kunne omfatte helseopplysninger, genetiske opplysninger og biometriske opplysninger jf. Personvernforordningen artikkel 9 (1) som selvrapporterte helseopplysninger, undersøkelsesdata, bildedata og uttrekk fra journalopplysninger.*

**Agreement tag**

This is our internal tag (short cut) for your organization. This is added by us prior to the rendering.

### Enighetsavtale within NTNU

Data processor agreements are agreed between enterprises. We have therefore developed a separate "enighetsavtale" template for departments within NTNU (since we both are part of the same enterprise). 

The "enighetsavtale" clarifies the same rights and protections as our regular processor agreement with one exception: Disputes will be resolved with binding effect by NTNU's management with our Rector as the last instance.

### Data subprocessor agreement

Sometimes you may be processing data where the processing purpose if defined by another organization than your host organization. 

In such circumstances your may be "data processor", the data provider may be the "data controller", and we may be the "data subprocessor". We have dedicated agreement templates for such setups that gets defined under "Agreement type" in the agreement form fields (see above). 

To illustrate, this may be the case where you provide analytical expertise to a project that is controlled by another organization, and were you want to transfer their data to your lab to take advantage of your established tools and resources.

[Contact us](/contact) if you wonder which of the two agreement types that fits your processing needs.

### Use your own processing template

Sometimes your host organization prefers their own data processing agreement template. This is fine with us as long as the template is compliant with requirements set forth in GDPR, other relevant laws, and that we are able to comply with your organization's security requirements. Please note that such templates will need involvement from NTNU's legal team. [Contact us](/contact) for time estimates.




















## Data space agreements

A **`data space`** is our overarching service where a research leader manage one to many labs in HUNT Cloud. 

The data space agreement regulates how cloud resources are controlled and billed across these labs. The aim of this agreement is to ensure predictable services from where you can elevate your science.

### Regulations

The data space agreement includes specification of the cloud services made available, use of these services, support and service levels and general agreement terms. The data space agreement do also specify services cost, metering and billing.

The agreements include seven attachments: services specifications, service levels, price list, list of attached labs, lab agreement templates, user agreement templates and a contact list.

### Signatories

The data space agreement are signed by the data space leader (normally the principal investigator of a research center or research group), the data controller, and the individual accepting the financial risk on behalf of the institution (if this differ from the data controller) and us.
