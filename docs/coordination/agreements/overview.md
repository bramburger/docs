# Overview of agreements

This page contains a structured overview of the necessary agreements to fully utilize our cloud services to make your science fly. The information is intended for coordinators. 

[[toc]]

## Agreement hierarchy

Our agreements are organized in the following hierarchy: 

1. The **Data processor agreement** regulates data ownership and data protection. This is the core agreement for where all other agreements are incorporated as amendments.
2. The **Services agreement** is attached to one data processor agreement and regulates the cloud services specifications and conditions for resource consumption, cost and billing.
3. The **Data space agreement** is attached to one services agreement and defines one central space where research leaders coordinates one to many labs.
4. The **Lab agreement** is attached to one data space agreement and defines one digital environment that combines access to cloud resources for individual data processing.
5. The **User agreement** is attached to one lab agreement and authorizes one individual (lab user) access to one individual lab. 

We know, this is complex. Although it might seem complicated at the first glance, we think that the hierarchy provides a solid framework for flexibility. All to ensure your researchers freedom to explore.



## Data processor agreements

The data processor agreement is on top of our agreement hierarchy because it regulates one of the most important asset in digital science: your organization's trustworthiness towards research participants (data protection and data privacy).

The remaining agreements on this page are therefore formally incorporated into the data processor agreement as attachments. 



### Content

In short, the data processor agreement defines that your organization owns the data that you upload and generate in HUNT Cloud. And it specify the required privacy and security controls that are to be in place to protect your data. 

The data processor agreement allows your research to be compliant with the Data Protection Directive from EU (GDPR) and relevant Norwegian laws and regulations, including partly compliance with the Norwegian «*Norm for informasjonssikkerhet*».

### Parties

The data processor agreement is formally agreed between your host organization that control your data (data controller), and our host institution that process the data on your behalf (data processor). 

Your signatory will be the individual that is authorize to control your data on behalf of your organization. This may range from top management via head of departments to individuals in various organizational units.

Our signatory will be the head of our department: Department of Public Health and Nursing at the Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, NTNU.

### "Enighetsavtale" within NTNU

Data processor agreements are agreed between enterprises. We have therefore developed a separate "enighetsavtale" for departments within NTNU (since we both are part of the same enterprise). 

The "enighetsavtale" clarifies the same rights and protections as our regular processor agreement with one exception: Disputes will be resolved with binding effect by NTNU's management with our Rector as the last instance.

### Data subprocessor agreement

Sometimes you may be processing data on behalf of others. This is the case when the processing purpose if defined by another organization than your host organization (contract research). 

To illustrate, this may be the case if you provide analytical expertise to a project that is controlled/managed by another organization, and you want to transfer their data to your lab to take advantage of your established tools and resources.

In such circumstances your data provider may be the "data controller" and you may be the "data processor". If so, HUNT Cloud may be the "data subprocessor" (data underbehandler). We have dedicated agreement templates for such setups that gets defined under "Agreement type" in the agreement form fields (see above). 



[Contact us](/contact) if you wonder which of the two agreement types that fits your processing needs.

### Private processing templates

Your host organization may prefer to use their own data processing agreement template. This is fine with us as long as the template is compliant with requirements set forth in GDPR, other relevant laws, ISO 27001, and that we are able to comply with your organization's security requirements. Please note that such templates will need involvement from legal teams from your organization and NTNU. [Contact us](/contact) for time estimates of such arrangements.











## Services agreements

The services agreement regulates how cloud resources are controlled and billed across data spaces and labs. 

The aim of this agreement is to establish a unified way to control services and resources, and to simplify the establishments of data spaces and labs attached to the this agreement.

### Content

The services agreement regulates conditions for the use of the cloud services services, as well as specifications of services, support responsiveness and service levels. The agreement do also specify cost, metering and billing of services as well as the following attachments:

- services specifications
