The following changes was introduced 1 July 2021:

## Lab agreement update

We have updated the lab agreeement ([lab order](/agreements/downloads/#lab-order)) do include information on "lawful processing" (ethical approavals, privacy justifaction etc). We do this to help your host organization assembling lists of processing in our services. The update will require all new and existing labs to convert to the new version.

**Practical aspects:** All new will be required to use the new lab order from 1 July 2021. Existing labs needs to sign the new lab order from 1 October 2021 to upgrade or change resources, or at the latest by 1 January 2022 to continue their services.

**Dependencies:** New lab orders are dependent on a signed services agreement and an active data space. [Contact us](/contact) to start this process.

## Data space as a new unit

Data space is now introduced as a new subscription service. We do this to ease the management of one to many labs. The data space subscription defines service availability for labs. Activation of a data space will require an active services agreement (see below) and a new [data space order](/agreements/downloads/#data-space-order). 

**Practical aspects:** All new labs needs to be attached to a data space from 1 July 2021. Existing labs needs to be attached to a data space from 1 October 2021 to upgrade or change resources, or at the latest by 1 January 2022 to continue their services. 

**Dependencies:** New data spaces are dependent on a signed services agreements. [Contact us](/contact) to start this process.

## Services center as a new unit

[Services centers](/agreements/overview/#services-agreements) is now introduced as the new agreement unit that control services specifications and prices. We do this to separate financial aspects of the cloud services (services centers) from the scientific management (data spaces). Services centers are defined in our new services agreement where services specifications and prices are incorporated as appendixes.

**Practical aspects:** All new labs and data spaces needs to be attached to a services center from 1 July 2021. Existing labs and data spaces needs to be attached to a data space from 1 October 2021 to upgrade or change services and resources, or at the latest by 1 January 2022 to continue their services. 

**Dependencies:** New services agreements are dependent on a signed data processor agreement (or enighetsavtale for NTNU departments). [Contact us](/contact) to start this process.

## Services specifications update

We have updated the [services specifications](/services/specifications) with information on meter, cost, and billing of our services. The updates will be effective from 1 July 2021. The document is attached to the services agreement. 


## New price list

We are announcing the new [price list](prices/price-list) 1 July 2021. We do this to increase the sustainability and predictability of our services. [Click here](/prices/introduction) for and introduction to the price model.

The price list will be effective from 1 October 2021. Costs are metered and billed in accordance with our services specifications. The document is attached to the services agreement.

**Practical aspects:** Allocated lab resources per 1 July 2021 will be metered and billed from 1 January 2021, and new resources deployed after 1 July 2021 will be metered and billed from 1 October 2021.

**Dependencies:** The new price list is dependent on signed services agreement, data space orders and lab orders. [Contact us](/contact) to start this process.

## Billing account as a new form

We have introduced a new form with billing account information ([billing account form](/agreements/downloads/#billing-account-form)). The form is attached to a data space and may, depending on the data space subscription level, define the entire data space or individual labs as billing points.

**Practical aspects:** All new data spaces needs to register an billing account from 1 July 2021. Existing labs and data spaces needs to register an account from 1 October 2021 to upgrade or change services and resources, or at the latest by 1 January 2022 to continue their services. 

**Dependencies:** Registration of a billing account is dependent of an active data space.
