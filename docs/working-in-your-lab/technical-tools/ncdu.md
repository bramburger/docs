# Ncdu

[Ncdu](https://dev.yorhel.nl/ncdu/man) is a disk usage analyzer with an ncurses interface. It is designed to find space hogs on a remote server where you don't have an entire graphical setup available, but it is a useful tool even on regular desktop systems. Ncdu aims to be fast, simple and easy to use, and should be able to run in any minimal POSIX-like environment with ncurses installed.

## Linux

Install `ncdu` with the following:

```
sudo apt install ncdu
```

Then to start `ncdu`, simply run:

```
ncdu
```
