# Ting weeks

These are the times of the year were we come together for information, feedback and discussions on how to develop HUNT Cloud so you best can elevate your data-driven science. 

We arrange a set of "tings" for different parts of our community spread out over a week. We call these weeks "ting weeks". We aim to hold ting weeks three times a year, in the fall, winter and spring.

## Tings

We define our tings as "[appointed time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thing_(assembly)#Etymology)" where various members of the HUNT Cloud community meet to discuss how to best optimize for value extractions from raw materials and technologies within the community. The inspiration is drawn from the Old Norse ting structures such as [Frostating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostating) in Tr√∏ndelag.

We aim to establish a layered ting structure with discussions that should be meaningsful for those that participate.

### Lab ting

All lab users are invited to our lab ting.

This ting will focus on the development of our core technologies and processes that your meet in your lab envrionments, such as storage, compute, transfer, documentation and guide, onboarding, communicaton etc.

The ting is scheduled for two hours. The first part will be structured by the HUNT Cloud team with information, feedback and discussions on new developments and known pain. The last part will give room for an unstructured question and answer section.

### Coordinator ting

Research coordinators from data controllers, data spaces and individual labs are invited.

This ting will focus on optimization of research management and research coordination within your data spaces and labs. This may include topics such as agreement structures, user management, resource management, lab portfolio management etc.

The ting is scheduled for two hours. The first part will be structured by the HUNT Cloud team with information, feedback and discussions on new developments and known pain. The last part will give room for an unstructured question and answer section.

### Lagtun

Data controllers and major contributors are invited.

This is our top level ting where we meet to the overall strategic direction for HUNT Cloud and data-driven science.

The ting is scheduled for two hours. The first part will be structured with information, feedback and discussions on scheduled topics. The last part will give room for an unstructured question and answer section.

We aim to hold ting weeks three times a year, in the fall around the autumn holidays, in the winter around the winter holidays and in the spring around the national holiday i Norway.
