# Journey

**Data for a better world!**

We started our HUNT Cloud journey back in 2013, almost 30 years after the HUNT study handled their first digital sensitive information.

The need for a trustworthy cloud service evolved from the large digitization efforts of DNA from the HUNT Biobank. The HUNT community saw a pressing need for flexible analytical environments and scalable storage, both for national and international researchers. 

We adapted HUNT Cloud from a private cloud for HUNT researcher to a community cloud for the broader scientific community in 2017.
