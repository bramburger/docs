# Journey

Our HUNT Cloud journey started in 2013, almost 30 years after the HUNT study stored their first sensitive health information on computers.

The need for a dedicated trustworthy cloud service evolved from the large digitization efforts of DNA from the HUNT Biobank at the beginning of 2010. The HUNT community saw a pressing need for flexible analytical environments and scalable storage, both for national and international researchers. 

We adapted HUNT Cloud from a private cloud for HUNT researcher to a community cloud for the broader scientific community in 2017.
