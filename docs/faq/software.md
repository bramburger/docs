# Software

## Can we install our own software?

Yes, you can install software in your lab environment under our _bring-your-own-software_ policy, for example using the following syntax:

```
sudo apt install <packagename>
```

## Can we bring our own license?

Yes, if you use software that needs paid licenses you may bring your own licenses under our _bring-your-own-license_-policy. It is the responsibility of the lab owner to ensure that licensed software is used in accordance with the license agreement inside the lab environments. We may help with configuration and compliance on _home_-machines for such setups, for example for Matlab and Stata.
