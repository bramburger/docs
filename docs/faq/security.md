## Incident reporting

### What is a security incident? 

For practical purposes, something that may lead to a data breach or a violation of our [use policy](/assets/hunt-cloud-user-agreement.pdf). 

::: details Our formal security incident definition
Understanding what constitutes a security incident that may lead to a data breach can be technically challenging, and available definitions used by different actors overlap only in part. Formally, we lean on the ISO-27005:2008 definition of a security incident: **"A single or a series of unwanted information security events that have a significant probability of compromising business operations and threatening information security."** Thus, A security incident is a broad term that includes many different kinds of events. A data breach is a type of security incident, however, not all security incidents may lead to breaches of sensitive data. As a take home message, [report the incident](/contact) if you are in doubt.

### What should I report?

If you are in doubt - [report the incident](/contact)! We will guide you on which information it's good to include. Please do also report all incidents with a an **`unintended and undesirable consequence`** of an action or behaviour in your lab, including those that may or have led to loss or interruption of data or services. We use this information to prioritize our maintenance and development work.

### Can I be punished for reporting?

We encourage incident reporting, and do not punish such activity. However, it is important to note that Norwegian law and your institutionâ€™s general employment conditions do apply (as for all the things we do).

### Can I report anonymously?

Yes. We recommend that your use a lawyer as your intermediate if you wish to remain anonymous.
