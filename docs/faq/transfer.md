# FAQ on data transfers

This page list frequently asked questions related to data transfers and network openings in labs.

[[toc]]

## Internal transfers (Kista)

### Can I transfer data directly to other labs? 

Yes. You can make your data reachable for other labs through our HUNT Kista service. Direct transfers outside of Kistas are blocked. 

### What is a Kista? 

Kista is our service for data transfers between labs in a simple and secure manner. You upload data to a dedicated environment (Kista, chest in english) where a dedicated individual in the receiving lab can download your data. We take the responsibility to ensure that data gets downloaded by the correct user and lab.

### How does a Kista work? 

Kistas are short-lived dedicated sftp-servers with named uploaders and downloaders from specific lab environments inside HUNT Cloud. We will give you specific instructions on how to upload and download data.

### How do I order a Kista? 

Lab leaders and Lab coordinators may request Kistas on email. You need to specify your lab name, the user that will upload data inside your lab, the name of the receiving lab, the name of the lab user that will download the data to the receiving lab, and the size of the Kista in gigabytes or terabytes. Allow for up to a week in deployment (usually a few days). 

### How long can I keep a Kista? 

All Kistas will automatically be destroyed after 30 days. Thus, Kistas are short-lived temporary transfer services. Do NOT use Kistas as a storage area for your data as they will be destroyed without further notice.

### Do I need to encrypt the data in a Kista? 

No, we don't think so. It is our responsibility to ensure the correct receiver of your data and the confidentiality of your data inside the Kista. We do also log the transfers, and such logs may be made available to your data controller on request.







## External transfers

### Can I transfer data directly to remote parties? 

Yes. We do allow direct data transfers to parties outside HUNT Cloud. Your lab leader may request openings for such transfers. See the [Network openings](/faq/transfer/#how-do-i-request-a-network-opening) section below for information on how to open for outbound data transfers.

### How do I request a network opening? 

Your lab leader can request network openings through our [network opening form](/about/agreements/#network-opening-form). We use this form to document outbound traffic from your lab.

### Why is my lab closed for remote transfers? 

All labs are closed for outbound data traffic at the time of deployment. Your lab leader may request openings for such transfers. See the [Network openings](/faq/transfer/#how-do-i-request-a-network-opening) section below for information on how to open for outbound data transfers.

### Can remote parties upload data to my lab? 

Unfortunately, remote parties can not at this stage upload data directly to your lab. However, we do have several options for such transfers, so please [contact us](/contact-us) for possible solutions.
