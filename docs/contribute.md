# Contribute

We are proud of the content on these pages. They have come together as a collaborative contribution from lab users in our cloud community. However, they are by no means perfect. We know it's frustrating when you don't find the instant fix to your problem at hand! We are therefore grateful if you would like to help new lab users on their way by sharing your hard earned tips and tricks.

Here are a couple of ways you can help out:

- **Suggest new content.** [Contact us](/contact) with ideas for new content that will help science fly. Also, keep asking us questions to improve the [FAQ section](/faq/) and tell us about troubles to improve the [troubleshooting section](/troubleshooting/).

- **Improve current content.** Improve the text directly on a page by clicking the **`Help us improve this page!`** link at the bottom of each page or create an issue on our [issue page](https://github.com/huntdatacenter/docs/issues). Please note that this requires a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. If you don't have one, feel free contact us directly.

- **Help out on Slack.** Participate in discussions on Slack to both help and learn from fellow users in topic related channels.
